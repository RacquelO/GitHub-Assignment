			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="assets/images/IMG_1605.jpg" alt="Racquel Ovadia's Picture" class="mypic">
			<p>Currently residing in New Jersey, Racquel Ovadia is a Rutgers University graduate. She double majored in Sociology and Criminal Justice; with minors in Criminology and Women and Gender Studies. Her studies have provided her with a wealth of knowledge in understanding human behavior and navigating social norms in our society. However, after working three years at the Rutgers Help Desk as a student, her interests gravitated towards technology and the web.</p>
			<p>Racquel is currently enrolled at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp and is set to graduate in July 2016. She aims to pursue a career in web development to further chase her passions.</p>
			<p>When Racquel isn't working on her coding skills, she is working full time at Software House International as a web administrator. </p>
			<p>In her spare time, Racquel can be found attempting to teach her two lazy cats the CSS Box Model; however, I think that may be a long... long term project.</p>
